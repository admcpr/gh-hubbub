# gh-reponark

# So what is this?
It's a GitHub CLI extension that pulls the config for all repos in a GitHub organization and displays them in a TUI. You can also filter for repos based on their config, so you can do exciting things like find repos that don't have CODEOWNERS or don't have branch protection enabled. I know, calm down.

# And why should I care?
You probably shouldn't but if you're a GitHub user with a lot of repos or a GitHub organization admin and you want a way to view details of your repos and find ones which aren't configured the way you want them then you might.

# What's a nark?
It's British slang for a [police spy or informer](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/nark).
